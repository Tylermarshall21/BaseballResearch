# BaseballResearch
GitHub Repository Containing my Personal Baseball Research

The NESCAC folder contains an independent project I completed where I calculated the offensive WAR, wOBA, wRC for every player in the NESCAC (conference I play in at Amherst). The NESCAC Position Player WAR and wRC.Rmd contains all the code I used to scrape the data as well as calculate the statistics. The PDF is the compiled version of this document. The NESCAC-Shiny folder contains the app.R file I used to create a Shiny App to display my findings.

The JS-report folder contains a class project for my Advanced Data Analysis course where I used the James-Stein estimator to predict pitcher performance. The folder includes my final report in both .rmd and PDF files as well as the app.r file for the Shiny App I created as a part of the project. The Shiny App allows the user to explore the project beyond the findings included in the report. The raw data used in the project from the 2018 and 2019 MLB seasons are also in this folder.
