# BaseballResearch
GitHub Repository Containing my Personal Baseball Research

The NESCAC folder contains an independent project I completed where I calculated the offensive WAR, wOBA, wRC for every player in the NESCAC (conference I play in at Amherst). The NESCAC Position Player WAR and wRC.Rmd contains all the code I used to scrape the data as well as calculate the statistics. The PDF is the compiled version of this document. The NESCAC-Shiny folder contains the app.R file I used to create a Shiny App to display my findings.
